###### CONTENTS:
1.  FalsePosition  
+ This algorithm uses the method of false position in order to locate roots of a function (for more information visit the FalsePosition README)
2.  LUDecomposition  
+ This algorithm decomposes a matrix using the L U method (for more information visit the LUDecomposition README)
3.  Prime   
+ This function searches for prime numbers within user defined limits 
4.  QuadRoots  
+ This script asks for inputs of a coefecient matrix and outputs the roots of the polynomial
5.  SimpsonsOneThirdRule  
+ This algorithm uses the simpsons one third rule in order to integrate a table of values
